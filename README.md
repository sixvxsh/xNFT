# xNFT

An xNFT is a new token standard built on the Solana blockchain that is executable tokenized code representing ownership rights over its use. What this means is that an xNFT can itself be a platform for operable web3 applications.

Additionally, xNFTs are applications built directly into the digital assets that they represent. With xNFTs, you do not have to link your wallet to any website. This means that users arenâ€™t obligated to depend on any third-party software to use and access their assets. 

The new xNFT framework is a game-changer for Solana, which will provide the network and platform for this exciting use-case.
